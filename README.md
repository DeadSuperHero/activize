activize
========

Activize is a fun little weekend project to build a basic petition app built with Ruby on Rails.  The goal is to create a platform which features the following:

* A user authentication system powered by Mozilla Persona and Devise
* Users can create multiple petitions and sign multiple petitions
* User profiles show which petitions a user has signed
* A dashboard for tracking petition progress
* a meter on every petition for depicting progress on getting signatures
* Tagging via the acts_as_taggable_on gem, allowing for basic search
* Libravatar support, instead of just regular Gravatar
* One signature per person per petition.
